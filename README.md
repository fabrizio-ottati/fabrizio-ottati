### Fabrizio Ottati

So:
* I have two beautiful cats, Artù and Merlino.
* I completed my Ph.D. in Politecnico di Torino, doing research on hardware acceleration of **spiking neural networks** for **event-based vision** tasks.
* I work as **AI/ML Processor Engineer** @ NXP semiconductors.
* I am a co-founder of the [Open Neuromorphic](https://open-neuromorphic.org) initiative, even though I do not believe in SNNs at all 🙃 

I am mainly interested in **deep learning**, **computer architecture** and **computer science**.
